22.9
From point A, square a line # left, mark endpoint, label H back hip arc + .3cm 28.2 .3cm for ease
From point C, square a line # left, mark endpoint, label F back hip arc + .3cm 28.2 .3cm for ease
From point D, square a line #, mark endpoint, label I Use greater of
1.25 x (back hip
arc + .3) 35.3 this step incorporates a subsequent fit check, and
includes some adjustments required to draft this
piece independent of the front piece.
OR, (upperleg +
3.8 + 1.9) – (front
hip arc + .3+ front
crotch extension) (64.8 + 3.8 + 1.9)
– (25.4 +.3 +5.7)
=39.1 Includes 3.8 cm recommended crotch ease and
1.9cm placeholder that will be removed later.
Front
crotch extension values are hips <94.0 =4.8,
hips 94.1-106.4 = 5.1, hips >106.5 = 5.7.
These values
are supplied by Armstrong. They're probably fine
but the drafting instructions only go to American
size 18 (hips 111) and I'm not sure how they'll
work for larger folks. Should try to test this so
there's no surprises.
Starting at point H, square down through point F, till
intersecting with line D-I. Label intersection point G
On line G-H, measure # from point G, mark endpoint, label
X .5(crotch depth) 15.6 On line A-H, measure # from point H, toward point A, mark
point, label N 4.5 4.5 Fixed value, sets reference point for back waist.
On line A-H, measure from point N toward point A, # mark
endpoint, label O back waist arc +
2.5 22.8 2.5 fixed value for dart width. Ok that it's fixed, it's
mostly a placeholder and gets removed, rolled or
replaced in pant patterns. If additional shaping is
required it can be placed in hip curve.
On line A-H, measure from point N # toward O, mark
endpoint, label P .5 (back waist arc + 11.4
2.5) 2.5 fixed value for dart placement.
Square line # down from P, mark endpoint, no label 8.9 8.9 Fixed value for dart length. See previous note on
fixed dart value.
Square out # from P on both sides, mark endpoints, no
label. 1.0 1.0 Fixed value for dart width. See previous note.
Square up # from point N, mark endpoint, label T 2.5 2.5 Fixed value for height of back rise.

4.4 4.4 Fixed value as reference for crotch curve.
1.0 1.0 Fixed point as reference for hip curve. This value
was already included in line D-I, so that it could be
removed at this stage.
On line D-I, mark new point # halfway between between V
and I, label W 19.0 I measured/divided manually, you'll let the
computer do this.
From point W, square up to line A-H (waistline) and down # waist to ankle,
to knee and # to ankle to create grainline Mark knee and
waist to knee
ankle points 100.3, 61.0 Threw this in so I could complete the crotch and
hip curves.
Draw curve touching X and g, ending at/near I, blend at g if
needed.
Draw slightly curved line from T to O.
Draw dart legs through side points, up to curved T-O line
True dart by raising shorter leg and redrawing line to O.
Draw hip curve from just above C to O
On line D-I, mark new point # to left of D, label V
At knee point square and center a # line, mark endpoints, no (knee circ / 2) + 2.5 (40.6/2) + 2.5 =
label
22.8 Knee and ankle circs are needed to build hip and
crotch curves correctly. I used my measurement
with 1 inch of ease allocated to the back.
Armstrong offers fixed values for knees that make
no sense, so I want to fiddle with this and get your
comments.
At ankle point, square and center a line, mark endpoints, no (ankle entry circ /

     to work with. See above note about revisiting

     Draw a line from ankle points, through knee points, to line
     D-I.
     Creates in/out seams and guide for hip and crotch
     curves
     Draw curve down from I to inseam, blending curve into
     seam about midway between knee and line D-I. Ensure first
     inch of curve down from I is at 90 degree angle to upward
     curve from I.
     Draw curve down from V to outseam, blending curve into
     seam about midway between knee and line D-I.
     Correct crotch length by pitching crotch seam up/down at
     point F
     back crotch length 45.2 – 40 = 5.2
     – (T-X-g-I) = pitch

     Lucky you, the computer will handle this! Negative
     result means downward pitch
